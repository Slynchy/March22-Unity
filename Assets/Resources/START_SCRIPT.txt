This is a popular retreat for couples in the summer. The deciduous trees provide a beautiful green canopy, far out of sight of teachers and fellow students.

But now, in late winter, it feels like I'm standing under a pile of kindling.

I breathe into my cupped hands and rub them together furiously to prevent them from numbing in this cold.

hi "Just how long am I expected to wait out here, anyway? I'm sure the note said 4:00 PM."

//ClearCharacters

Ah yes… the note… slipped between the pages of my math book while I wasn't looking.

As far as clichés go, I'm more a fan of the letter-in-the-locker, but at least this way shows a bit of initiative.

As I ponder the meaning of the note, the snowfall gradually thickens.

The snowflakes silently falling from the white-painted sky are the only sign of time passing in this stagnant world.

Their slow descent upon the frozen forest makes it seem like time has slowed to a crawl.

PlaySting rustling

The rustling of dry snow underfoot startles me, interrupting the quiet mood. Someone is approaching me from behind.

mystery "Hi… Hisao? You came?"

A hesitating, barely audible question.

However, I recognize the owner of that dainty voice instantly.

I feel my heart skip a beat.

It's a voice I've listened to hundreds of times, but never as more than an eavesdropper to a conversation.

I turn to face this voice, the voice of my dreams, and my heart begins to race…

hi "Iwanako? I got a note telling me to wait here… it was yours?"

Dammit. I spent all afternoon trying to come up with a good line and that was the result.

Pathetic.

iwanako "Ahmm… yes. I asked a friend to give you that note… I'm so glad you got it."

A shy, joyous smile that makes me so tense I couldn't move a single muscle even if I tried.

hi "So… ah… here we are. Out in the cold…"

Once again, the wind stirs up the branches. The cacophonous noise is music to my ears.

Iwanako flinches ever so softly against the gust of wind.

As it passes, she rights herself, as if supported by some new confidence.

Her eyes lock with mine and she lazily twirls her long, dark hair around her finger.

All the while, the anxious beating of my heart grows louder.

In that whole time, I can probably count the times I've left this hospital room unsupervised on one hand.

Four months is a pretty long time when you're left alone with your thoughts. So, I've had plenty of time to come to terms with my situation.

//Transition hosp_room tr_eyes out

Arrhythmia.

A strange word. A foreign, alien one. One that you don't want to be in the same room with.

A rare condition. It causes the heart to act erratically and occasionally beat way too fast. It can be fatal.

Apparently, I've had it for a long time. They said it was a miracle that I was able to go on so long without anything happening.

Is that really a miracle? I guess it was supposed to make me feel better, more appreciative of my life.

It really didn't do anything to cheer me up.

NewPage

My parents, I think, were hit harder by the news than I was. They practically had two hemorrhages apiece.

I had already had a full day by then to digest everything. To them, it was all fresh. They were even willing to sell our house in order to pay for a cure.

Of course there isn't a cure.

NewPage

Because of the late discovery of this… condition, I've had to stay at the hospital, to recuperate from the treatments.

When I was first admitted, it felt as if I was missed…

For about a week, my room in the ward was full of flowers, balloons and cards.

But, the visitors soon dwindled and all the get-well gifts began trickling down to nothing shortly after.

I realized that the only reason I had gotten so many cards and flowers was because sending me their sympathy had been turned into a class project.

Maybe some people were genuinely concerned, but I doubt it. Even in the beginning, I barely had visitors. By the end of the first month, only my parents came by on a regular basis.

Iwanako was the last to stop visiting.

After six weeks, I never saw her again. We never had that much to talk about when she visited, anyway.

We didn't touch the subject that was between us on that snowy day ever again.

NewPage

\nThe hospital?

It's not really a place I'd like to live in.

The doctors and nurses feel so impersonal and faceless.

I guess it's because they are in a hurry and they have a million other patients waiting for them, but it makes me feel uncomfortable.

For the first month or so, I asked the head cardiologist every time I saw him for a rough estimate of when I'd be able to leave.

He never answered anything in a straightforward way, but told me to wait and see if the treatment and surgeries worked.

\nSo, I idly observed the scar that those surgeries had left on my chest slowly change its appearance over time, thinking of it as some kind of an omen.

I still ask the head cardiologist about leaving, but my expectations are low enough now that I'm not disappointed any more when I don't get a reply. The way he shuffles around the answer shows that there is at least some hope.

NewPage

\n\n\n\nAt some point I stopped watching TV. I don't know why, I just did.

Maybe it was the wrong kind of escapism for my situation.

\nI started reading instead. There was a small “library” at the hospital, although it was more like a storeroom for books. I began working my way through it, one small stack at a time. After consuming them, I would go back for more.

I found that I liked reading and I think I even became a bit addicted. I started feeling naked without a book in my hands.

\nBut I loved the stories.

NewPage

\nThat was what my life was like.

\nThe days became increasingly harder to distinguish from each other, differing only by the book I was reading and the weather outside. It felt like time blurred into some kind of gooey mass I was trapped inside, instead of moving within.

A week could go by without me really noticing it.

Sometimes, I'd pause in realization that I didn't know what day of the week it was.

But other times, all the things that surrounded me would painfully crash into my consciousness, through the barrier of nonchalance I had set up for myself.

The pages of my book would start to feel sharp and burning hot and the heaviness in my chest would become so hard to bear that I had to put the book aside and just lay down for a while, looking at the ceiling as if I was going to cry.

But that happened only rarely.

\nAnd I couldn't even cry.

Today, the doctor comes in and gives me a smile. He seems excited, but not very. It's like he is trying to make an effort to be happy on my behalf.

My parents are here. It's been a few days since I've last seen them. Both of them are even sort of dressed up. Is this supposed to be some kind of special occasion? It's not a party.

There is this ritual the head cardiologist has. He takes his time, sorting his papers, then setting them aside as if to make a point of the pointlessness of what he just did.

Then he casually sits down on the edge of the bed next to mine. He looks me in the eyes for a moment.

op_doctor Hello, Hisao. How are you today?

I don't answer him but I smile a little, back at him.

op_doctor I believe that you can go home; your heart is stronger now, and with some precautions, you should be fine.

op_doctor We have all your medication sorted out. I'll give your father the prescription.

The doctor hands a sheet of paper to my dad, whose expression turns wooden as he reads it quickly.

op_dad So many…

I take it from his hand and take a look myself, feeling numb. How am I supposed to react to this?
